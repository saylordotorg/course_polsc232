Course Syllabus for "POLSC232: American Government"
---------------------------------------------------

American Government belongs to the Saylor.org CLEP® PREP Program. In
taking this version of POLSC232, you will master the subject of American
Government and Politics. This course is also designed to prepare you to
take the [CLEP® exam in American
Government](http://clep.collegeboard.org/exam/american-government). The
CLEP® (College Level Examination Program) exams are designed by the
College Board, the organization which administers the AP and SAT exam
programs you may have encountered or taken in high school. CLEP® exams
test for the mastery of college-level material that you may have
acquired through any number of ways – college-level course instruction,
independent study, work experience, or any other program of study you
have pursued. In other words, CLEP® exams are freestanding exams that
any individual can pay to take in order to prove that he or she has
mastered a given subject area at the college level. Over 2,900 US
colleges and universities recognize and award college credit for a
satisfactory score on a CLEP® exam. A student who earns a satisfactory
score can be eligible for the same amount of college credit as a student
who has successfully completed the same course at a traditional academic
institution. Prospective students interested in accelerated degree
programs are usually encouraged to take the CLEP® test. When you
successfully pass each test, you will receive college credit that can:
-   accelerate your degree;
-   allow you to skip beginner courses and/or to take higher-level
    courses faster;
-   help determine your readiness for classes;
-   apply knowledge you already have; and
-   save money on books and tuition.

All CLEP® exams are administered in multiple-choice format by computer.
The American Government CLEP® exam contains 100 multiple choice
questions to be answered in 90 minutes. The fee for each CLEP® exam is
$80, plus any service fees payable to the testing center. However,
eligible military service members and civilian employees can take CLEP®
exams free of charge.

Interest Groups*, you will discuss the organizations and processes that
impact the political and electoral landscape and how candidates and
voters are affected.

governing bodies in the United States: Congress, the presidency, the
bureaucracy, and the courts.

freedoms and rights of its citizens.  
  
 In our final unit, *Policy Making in American Government*, you will

behavior, and governmental institutions have intersected to shape
them.
