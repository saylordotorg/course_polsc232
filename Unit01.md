**Unit 1: American Political Foundations** <span id="1"></span> 
*The American political system is rich in history. In order to gain a
comprehensive understanding of American government, you will need to
learn this history and recognize the ways in which it impacts the
political landscape today.*  
  
 *This unit will begin with a brief introduction to the course as well
as a concise overview of the American political system. You will focus
on broad-based questions and explore the defining characteristics of
American government. Next, you will work to identify the origins of
American republican democracy, learning how it developed and evolved
into our current political system. Finally, you will conclude by
examining the key principles embedded in the United States Constitution,
particularly federalism, and relate its design and development to the
unique American political system we have in place today.*

    easily tyrannize the minority. The Founding Fathers understood this
    and worked to fashion a government that would balance these two
    concepts.

    influenced the formation of the American government. The language
    used in the Declaration of Independence provides some insight into
    how Founding Fathers designed the Constitution in a way that would
    prevent tyranny of the majority.

    articles explain some of its most glaring defects. Representatives
    of the states later held a constitutional convention to address
    these weaknesses.

    a primary source for interpretation of the Constitution. This

     Instructions: Read *Federalist 10* and *51,* two of the most famous
    *Federalist Papers* written by James Madison. These are among the
    most highly regarded of all American political writings. For
    *Federalist 10*, identify why Madison believes that the Constitution
    provides for a form of government that will control factionalism and
    fulfill the will of the people. *Federalist 51 *addresses the means
    by which appropriate checks and balances can be created in a
    democracy, and advocates a separation of powers within the national
    government. One of its most important ideas is the oft-quoted phrase
    “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.”  
      
     The *Federalist Papers* are accessible through a website maintained

     Instructions: Select and read **one** of Alexander Hamilton’s
    *Federalist Papers* (*16* or *17*). In both of these essays,
    Hamilton argues the need for a strong national government to unify
    the country, and seeks to address concerns that the proposed
    Constitution will lead to tyranny.  
      
     Also read James Madison’s *Federalist 39*, which strikes a more
    conciliatory tone towards the federal aspects of the government
    (Hamilton only expounds on the national aspects). Madison believes
    that only a republican form of government can carry forward the
    principles of the Revolution and demonstrate that self-government is
    both possible and practical.

     Instructions: Watch this two-part presentation on the key elements
    of federalism in the American political system. *Layer cake*
    federalism (also known as “dual federalism”) describes a certain
    form of federalism, in which the national and state governments have
    distinct realms of authority that do not overlap and should not
    intrude. This form of federalism is in direct contrast to *marble
    cake* or *cooperative* federalism (more on this in the next
    subunit), which is based on a mixing of authority and programs among
    the national, state, and local governments.  
      
     For each topic, click the *Explore* heading to read more specific
    content about federalism. Use the glossary to highlight and review
    important terms discussed in this presentation.

    Federalism”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFD5VJYuGB8) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch this two-part presentation on cooperative and
    fiscal federalism. While fiscal federalism has resulted in federal
    monies for states in a wide variety of areas – agricultural,
    transportation, and research – some states have expressed concern
    about burdensome regulations and requirements. In recent years,
    there has been a push to return power to the states (*devolution*),
    placing the burden of a wide range of domestic programs on state
    governments so that they can design programs in a way that suits
    their own residents.  
        
     The Democratic and Republican parties stand for different
    principles with regard to federalism. Democrats prefer policies to
    be set by the national government. They opt for national standards
    for consistency across states and localities, often through
    attaching stringent conditions to the use of national funds.
    Republicans usually decry such centralization and endorse giving
    powers to the states and reducing funds for the national government.
    These differences reveal the parties’ divergent political ideologies
    on the “proper” role of government. This topic is discussed further
    in subunit 2.1.3.
