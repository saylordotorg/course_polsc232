**Unit 2: American Political Behavior** <span id="2"></span> 
*The diverse American public is a major component of the American
political system. Politics touches the lives of all Americans – voters,
politicians, the young, the old, and everyone in between. Political
scientists are extremely interested in studying how the public
participates in the American political system. This unit will explore
the processes by which citizens learn about politics, political
participation and voting behavior, the influence of public opinion, the
role of the media, and the variety of factors that predispose citizens
to differ from one another in terms of their political perceptions,
values, and attitudes.*
