**Unit 3: Political Parties, Campaigns, Elections, and Interest Groups**
<span id="3"></span> 
*There are innumerable factors that impact the American governmental
system, often making an already byzantine political process even more
complex. In this unit, you will learn about campaigns, the electoral
process and how political parties and interest groups shape the
political landscape by influencing candidates and voters. You will first
focus on the role of political parties (especially in elections), their
historical development, and their effect on the political process. You
will also discover how the American political system maintains a strong
two-party system (i.e., Democrats and Republicans) that makes it
difficult for a third party to gain prominence. Next, you will focus on
interest groups, how they impact campaigns, candidates, and voters and
can often entrench the system through aggressive issue advocacy and
campaign contributions, which are directed to incumbents far more often
than challengers, helping to maintain the political status quo.*

     Instructions: Read Chapter 10, on pages 361-413. Political parties
    are essential to democracy – they simplify voting choices, organize
    the competition, unify the electorate, help organize government by
    bridging the separation of powers and fostering cooperation among
    branches of government, translate public preferences into policy,
    and provide loyal opposition.

     Instructions: Please read this concise historic explanation of
    political parties in the American system of government. Political
    parties are not mentioned in the Constitution. In fact, the Founding
    Fathers were wary of “factions” that could undermine democracy.
    However, political parties developed soon after the Constitution was
    written, largely out of necessity. The same leaders who opposed
    parties also recognized the need to organize officeholders who
    shared views so that government could operate effectively.

     Instructions: Watch this two-part presentation on party
    identification and national shifts in party control (realignment and
    dealignment) in the American political system. A person’s loyalty to
    or preference for one political party is called party
    identification. When people identify with a party, they usually
    agree with the party’s stance on a few major issues and give little
    weight to its stance on issues they consider minor or secondary.
    This presentation also discusses how some elections can serve as
    turning points that define the agenda of politics and the alignment
    of voters within parties during periods of historic change in the
    economy and society.

     Instructions: Read Chapter 11, on pages 414-469. Elections are
    crucial in a representative democracy like the United States. They
    enable people to choose their leaders and thereby influence public
    policy. They endow elected officials with legitimacy. There are two
    main types of elections: primary and general elections. Candidates
    from the same political party contest for the party’s nomination in
    primary elections. Candidates from different parties run in the
    general election, which decides who will take office.

     Instructions: Watch this video about the Iowa caucuses and how Iowa
    voters play an important role in nominating candidates for
    president. Historically, the Iowa caucuses have served as an early
    indication of which candidates for president might win the
    nomination of their political party at that party’s national
    convention, and which ones could drop out for lack of support. Think
    about the criticism that the Iowa caucuses’ role is too important in
    the early nominating process. Many believe that because its
    population does not reflect nationwide demographics, it should not
    be portrayed as an indicator of the types of voters that turn out in
    the general campaign.

     Instructions: Please watch this video, which discusses the role of
    the Electoral College in presidential elections. While watching the
    video, think about the implications that the Electoral College has
    on the American democratic system. When Al Gore won the popular vote
    in the 2000 presidential election but did not become president, a
    national debate grew around the Electoral College system. Supporters
    of eliminating the Electoral College advocate a direct popular
    election of the president, which would give every voter the same
    weight in accordance with the “one-person, one-vote” doctrine.
    Opponents contend that this type of plan would undermine federalism
    and make presidential campaigns more remote from voters, as
    candidates might stress television and give up their forays into
    shopping centers and city malls.

    decisions, these independent political action committees collect
    unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations and unions
    that they then spend to advocate for or against political candidates
    in the 2012 presidential race. John Dunbar of the Center for Public
    Integrity discusses who is behind these Super PACs and which
    candidates benefit most.

     Instructions: Read pages 1 through 71 to learn about redistricting
    – what it is, how it works, and why it matters. Unlike in many
    countries, the redistricting process in the United States is viewed
    as being overtly and acceptably political. Why do you think this is
    the case?

     Instructions: Read Chapter 9, on pages 331-360. Interest groups
    have long been important in electing and defeating candidates, in
    providing information to officeholders, and in setting the agenda of
    American politics. Americans have historically been concerned about
    the power of what some call *special interests*, and the tendency of
    groups to pursue self-interest at the expense of less organized
    groups or the general public. As this chapter shows, restraining the
    negative tendencies of interest groups while protecting liberty is
    not an easy task.

**3.3.1 History of Interest Groups in American Politics** <span
id="3.3.1"></span> 
This subunit is covered by the materials assigned beneath subunit 3.3.
What we call *interest groups* today, the founders of the Republic
called *factions*. For the framers of the Constitution, the foremost
problem was how to establish a stable and orderly constitutional system
that would also respect the liberty of free citizens and prevent the
tyranny of the majority or a single dominant interest. Today, interest
groups exist to make demands on government.

**3.3.2 Types of Interest Groups** <span id="3.3.2"></span> 
This subunit is covered by the materials assigned beneath subunit 3.3.
Interest groups vary widely. Some are formal associations or
organizations, while others have no formal organization. Some are
organized primarily to lobby for limited goals or to broadly influence
public opinion by publishing reports and mass mailings. Interest groups
can be categorized into several broad types.

**3.3.3 Lobbying and Other Interest Group Resources and Tools** <span
id="3.3.3"></span> 
This subunit is covered by the materials assigned beneath subunit 3.3.
For decades, interest groups have engaged in lobbying, but these efforts
have become much more significant as groups become more deeply involved
in the electoral process – especially through the expanded use of
political action committees (PACs), mass mailings, advertising
campaigns, and litigation.

**3.3.4 Evaluating the Impact of Interest Groups – Good or Bad for
Democracy?** <span id="3.3.4"></span> 
This subunit is covered by the materials assigned beneath subunit 3.3.
Media coverage of interest groups usually focuses on the activities of
powerful interest groups in finance, energy, and manufacturing. However,
an oft-quoted statement is that “the special interest is us,” meaning
that we are all beneficiaries of interest-group activity in the form of
consumer protection, cleaner air, safer drinking water, and workplace
safety. Is it perhaps more accurate to state that interest groups are
both good and bad for democracy? Do you agree with this statement? Why
or why not?
