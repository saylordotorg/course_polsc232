**Unit 4: American Political Institutions** <span id="4"></span> 
*When many people think of American government, the institutions –
Congress, the president, and the Supreme Court – most often come to
mind. This unit will focus on these three important pillars of American
government, in addition to a fourth and often overlooked facet of
American government*: *the bureaucracy. Each subunit will be dedicated
to one of the major institutions and discuss the significant role that
the particular institution plays in the American political system. As
you learned in previous units, the American system of government relies
on a delicate balance of power among many forces; by the end of this
unit, you will understand the specific roles that each institution plays
in establishing and maintaining that balance of power.*

     Instructions: Read Chapter 12, on pages 470-537. The US Congress is
    one of the world’s greatest democratic institutions. Members fight
    hard on behalf of their states and districts and are free to
    introduce legislation which supports their policy agendas and the
    needs of their constituents. Congress is also an intricate
    institution, within which it can be very difficult and
    time-consuming to pass legislation.There has been tension between
    representation and action since the very first Congress in 1789.
    Because Congress is divided into two houses with their own rules,
    procedures, and electoral bases, members often disagree about major
    legislation, even when the public wants action. However, as you will
    discover in this subunit, frustration does have a purpose, and was
    even built into our constitutional system.

     Instructions: Watch this two-part presentation to learn how a bill
    makes its way through the halls of Congress before it lands on the
    president’s desk to be signed into law. Thousands of bills are
    introduced each session in Congress, and these bills must traverse a
    highly complex legislative process involving committees, floor
    debates, interest-group influence, and party power struggles. This
    complexity not only slows the process of enacting legislation, it
    also provides a tremendous built-in advantage for opponents of any
    bill to block it. Supporters of a bill must have success at every
    step. Opponents need to win only once. Of the approximate 8,000
    bills that are introduced in every two-year congressional cycle,
    only five percent become public laws.

     Instructions: Please read this article on the use of logrolling and
    the pork barrel in political compromise. Logrolling is the trading
    of favors, or *quid pro quo*, such as vote trading by two (or more)
    legislative members to obtain passage of bills of interest to each
    member. This practice is common in many legislative bodies,
    including Congress, that often want to secure passage of bills that
    provide sizable benefits in their home districts. Most logrolling
    typically involves “pork barrel” funding for government programs
    whose economic or service benefits are concentrated in a particular
    area but whose costs are spread among all taxpayers. Public works
    projects, certain national defense spending projects, and
    agricultural subsidies are the most common examples.

     Instructions: Read this report, which discusses the basic structure
    and functionof congressional committees. Most of the work of
    Congress is conducted in committees, where policies are shaped and
    legislation is hammered out. President Woodrow Wilson once observed,
    “Congress in session is Congress on public exhibition, whilst
    Congress in its committee rooms is Congress at work.”

     Instructions: Read this report on the basic structure of leadership
    in the House of Representatives. An extensive leadership structure
    provides an organizational framework that helps House members work
    effectively, if not efficiently. At the top of the leadership
    hierarchy is the Speaker of the House, who is the body’s presiding
    officer. Majority and minority leaders help set their party’s agenda
    on issues. The whips encourage party unity on House votes.  
      
     This is one of the many reports that the Congressional Research
    Service has released to the public. The author of this report,
    Thomas Carr, is a widely respected scholar and expert on various
    components of the United States Congress.

     Instructions: Use this site to explore the various aspects of the
    Senate’s leadership structure. The Senate leadership consists of the
    presiding officer, majority leader, minority leader, and whips.
    Unlike in the House, where the Speaker wields considerable power,
    the presiding officer is not the most visible member of the Senate
    and can only vote in case of a tie. The majority and minority
    leaders work together to schedule and manage Senate business. Whips
    are less important in the Senate than in the House because the
    closer personal relationships that develop in the smaller body make
    it easier to know how members will vote without a formal whip
    count.  
      
     This resource is taken from the United States Senate informational
    web page, [www.senate.gov](http://www.senate.gov/). It provides a

     Instructions: Read this chapter, on pages 537-593. The United
    States was the first nation to create the office of president as the
    head of state in a modern republic, and today the presidential
    system of government is used in several countries. As of 2013, there
    have been 44 presidents of the United States. From the early
    20<sup>th</sup> century, the United States’ superpower status has
    made the President one of the world’s best-known public figures.
    During the Cold War, the President was called the “leader of the
    free world,” and since the collapse of the Soviet Union the
    President is often described as “the most powerful person on
    Earth.”

     Instructions: Please click on the above links to watch Dr. Woods’
    two lectures, in which he discusses how presidential power has
    evolved throughout history. Most historians believe that the
    “modern” presidency – the ability of the president to wield his
    power far above and beyond what is explicitly stated in the
    Constitution – began with the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in
    1933. FDR was also one of only a few presidents to facilitate a
    durable coalition that realigned American politics for decades.

     Executive privilege is the power claimed by the president and other
    members of the executive branch to resist certain subpoenas and
    other interventions by the legislative and judicial branches of
    government. The concept of executive privilege is not mentioned
    explicitly in the Constitution, but the Supreme Court ruled it to be
    an element of the separation of powers doctrine, and/or derived from
    the supremacy of the executive branch in its own area of
    constitutional activity. Various presidents – most infamously
    Richard Nixon – have invoked their right to executive privilege over
    a litany of issues they deemed to be private communications.

    historical and policy circumstances of the time. Franklin D.
    Roosevelt vetoed more legislation than any President before or after
    him. Why do you think this was the case?

    United States play a more active role in the political process than

    has a dual judiciary – federal and state court systems. In both
    federal and state courts, individuals must have standing to sue, and
    must assert a personal injury. Courts decide only justiciable cases,
    not political questions.

     Instructions: Read this report on the history, development, and
    organization of the US federal court system. Compared to the
    legislative and executive branches, the judicial branch did not
    receive as much attention in the drafting of the Constitution. The
    Constitution requires a Supreme Court, which the framers felt was a
    necessity if the national government were to have the power to make
    and enforce laws that would take precedence over state laws. As you
    may recall, the lack of a national court was one of the many
    shortcomings of the Articles of Confederation. However, the framers
    left it to Congress to create lower courts (also known as “Article
    III courts”).

     Instructions: Please watch Professor Chemerinsky’s lecture on the
    Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the only court that has complete
    control over the cases that it chooses to hear. Its nine justices
    dispose of thousands of cases annually, and most of their time is
    concentrated on the fewer than 100 cases per year that they accept
    for review. These cases usually deal with substantial federal
    questions or constitutional issues. The court’s decisions and
    opinions establish guidelines for lower courts around the country.

    Supreme Court justices interpret the law through the competing legal
    philosophies of judicial restraint versus judicial activism. This
    lesson also discusses the historic impact of the court’s immense
    power of judicial review, and how they are the final authority on
    the interpretation of the Constitution.

     Instructions: Read this article, which discusses the constitutional
    role of the Senate in confirming the President’s judicial
    nominations. The selection of federal judges has always been a
    significant part of the political process. It makes a difference who
    serves on the federal courts. The courts have come to play an even
    more important role in the policy-making process. And as more and
    more interests – African Americans and women, for example –
    participate inthis process, judicial-selection politics has come
    front and center on the political stage (which would probably dismay
    the Founding Fathers, whose goal was to create an independent
    judiciary free from political passions).

     Instructions: Please this video, which discusses how the Senate

    all the answers even if the first or second choice looks correct to
    you.
