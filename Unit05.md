**Unit 5: Civil Rights and Civil Liberties** <span id="5"></span> 
*The civil rights and civil liberties granted to Americans are central
to the American government. Freedoms and rights were important factors
in shaping the American political system, and they continue to play a
major role in our society today. The Constitution, especially the Bill
of Rights, defines our rights and freedoms; however, as society has
changed, so too has the perception and realization of civil liberty and
civil rights. In this unit, you will explore the freedoms and rights of
American citizens.  
  
 The unit will begin by looking at civil liberties guaranteed in the
Constitution, especially in the Bill of Rights. The unit will especially
focus on the rights defined in the First Amendment, the right to bear
arms (Second Amendment), and the right to privacy, with an explanation
of how the courts’ interpretation of these rights have been applied, or
incorporated, by the states. Next, the unit will explore the evolution
of civil rights in the American political system, with an emphasis on
the civil rights movement and political equality of all Americans. The
unit will also pay close attention to how the American political system
creates a balance between order and freedom, and equality and rights. *

     Instructions: Read the first 10 amendments to the Constitution,
    also known as the Bill of Rights, and the accompanying annotations.
    The Bill of Rights lists the individual rights and freedoms that
    government may not infringe upon. It was adopted in 1791 by the
    founders to address fears about the potential of the new federal
    government to abuse power. The Bill of Rights now applies, though
    unevenly, to the states as well as the federal government. What
    these liberties are and how far they extend continues to be the
    focus of political debate.

     Instructions: Please read the above article. The framers of the
    Constitution had fresh memories of a government that accused people
    of crimes they did not commit and then convicted them in unfair
    trials. Consequently, they went to great lengths to assure that the
    new government they established would not engage in such practices.
    Toward that end, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights guarantee a
    series of important protections for individuals accused of
    committing crimes in the United States.
