**Unit 6: Policymaking in American Government** <span id="6"></span> 
*After having explored the foundations, political behavior, and
institutions of the American political system, this final unit looks at
public policy in the United States, the place where all of these other
components of the American political system intersect. The unit will
begin examining the general policy-making process and how each branch of
government impacts American public policy. Then, the unit will take a
deeper look into the three major realms of public policy – economic,
social, and foreign affairs policy. In each of these realms, theories of
policy will be discussed, and then you will look closer at how policy
has been implemented over time. This unit is a fitting way to end the
course as it demonstrates how everything that you’ve learned thus far
comes together to shape the various public policies that impact American
society as a whole.*

     Instructions: Read Chapter 16, on pages 686-733. When government
    decides to act, it mostly does so through public policy, which is a
    specific course of action that government takes to address a
    problem, such as the federal budget deficit. A public policy can be
    conveyed to the public in the laws passed by Congress and signed by
    the president, opinions issued by the Supreme Court, and/or rules
    written by the executive branch. In many ways, public policy tells
    the public who gets what – and when and how – from government.

order to influence the economy. In recent years, credit, mortgage, and
regulatory policies have contributed to an economic crisis in the United

determined by the Federal Reserve Board. Fiscal policy is mainly made by
the President’s economic advisors and Congress.*
